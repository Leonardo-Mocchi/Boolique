## Team & Credits

Officially a 4-person student project, with varying levels of contribution. Main development was carried out by three active members, and the backend/database was primarily designed and maintained by the repository owner.

## Database Access

For educational or testing purposes, the database schema is available upon request. Contact the maintainer directly for access or setup instructions.

## Getting Started

See `frontend/BackendRoutes.md` and backend documentation for API details and setup instructions. To run locally, follow the installation steps in the respective folders.

For easier API testing and exploration, a Postman route collection is included in the `frontend/postman_routes_collection.json` file. You can import this file directly into Postman to access and test all API routes immediately.
